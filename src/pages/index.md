## Overview

Cloud Manager includes a full-featured web user interface at [https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/). The Cloud Manager API enables Cloud Manager customers to interact with many of the same underlying capabilities exposed through the web UI in a fully programmatic fashion. This allows for integration of the Cloud Manager Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery pipeline with other systems.

General information on Cloud Manager can be found in the Product Documentation in the Resources section.

The links in this documentation will guide you through getting started with the Cloud Manager API. There is also a complete [API Reference](reference/api/) which describes all of the individual endpoints and requests which are available for usage.
